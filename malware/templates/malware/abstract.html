            <p>With the growing usage of technology, intrusion detection became an emerging area of research. Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
attempts to identify and notify the activities of users as normal (or) anomaly. IDS is a nonlinear and complicated problem and
deals with network traffic data. Many IDS methods have been proposed and produce different levels of accuracy. This is why
development of effective and robust Intrusion detection system is necessary. In this paper, we have built a model for intrusion
detection system using random forest classifier. Random Forest (RF) is an ensemble classifier and performs well compared to other
traditional classifiers for effective classification of attacks. To evaluate the performance of our model, we conducted experiments
on NSL-KDD data set. Empirical result show that proposed model is efficient with low false alarm rate and high detection rate.</p>
